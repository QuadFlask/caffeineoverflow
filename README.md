### Game concept

The name "caffeine overflow" was inspired from ![stackoverflow](http://blog.moovweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/stackoverflow-logo.png)

Caffeine produces increased wakefulness, faster and clearer flow of thought, increased focus, and better general body coordination.

So, cup of coffee is important to programmers. (And java logo is also cup of coffee. lol)
